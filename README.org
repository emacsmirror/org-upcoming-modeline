** appt

=appt= is not itself integrated with org-mode, but if you do
=(add-hook 'org-finalize-agenda-hook #'org-agenda-to-appt)= it will
add appointments from that agenda to your list of future warnings, and
warn when you're getting closer. But the modeline just says "App't in
15 min." (it doesn't show the name of the event, and there's no
org-integration). However, by default it will keep popping up a small
window with the event name for you every so often when the event is
getting near.

In comparison, this package doesn't require you to open (the correct)
=org-agenda= first; it shows the actual org heading and adds
org-specific "actions" that you can select for the event. And since it
uses =org-ql=, it'll automatically remove the event (after a short
idle delay) if you remove it from your org file.
